| 10/29 |  1:15-1:45pm  | I went to the board and started brainstorming a solution. I realized that the data needed to be hashed, and I initially settled on a BST to store the hashes. After talking with classmates, we realized a hashmap would be a better approach. We spent a lot of time ironing out the specific details around how we would implement our approach. |
| 10/31 | 10:50-11:20am |                                                                                                                We spent a while as a class talking out how we wanted to approach this problem and generalized the concept of a hash map. Then, we did some math to find our ideal prime number for hashing and map size. It came out to 249998741. |
| 10/31 | 11:20-11:50am |                           I started writing code according to our plans from the beginning of class. I reached a bug where I had negative indices, so I added p to the hash and did another %p. I also realized I needed to store key value pairs in the map, so I added them. I pass all but one test case, and this last failure is due to time. |
| 11/3  |  5:10-5:40pm  |                                        I was told that the prime number we derived in class was too large by a classmate, who recommended I change it to 100003. This was because we hadn't factored in storing keys as well in the hashmap. Once I made this change and cleaned a few things up, my code ran much faster, passing all test cases. |
| 11/5  |  2:00-2:30pm  |      We discussed linear probing in class and started to implement it in our code. I started with insert, which was pretty straightforward, and then moved on to resize. I realized that a lot of the logic was repeated, so I started creating an insertPrimitive method that does the primitive actions of inserting. (forgot to commit, sorry!) |
| 11/5  |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                 I continued implementing insertPrimitive, abstraticing the idea of inserting to any table. I then started on search, which was also pretty straightforward, as we'd talked extensively about it in class. I have one or more bugs preventing my code from running. |
| 11/10 |  9:05-9:35pm  |                                                                                                                          I looked through my adding and resizing code and found a few issues with how I was handling resizing the hashmap. Once I fixed these small logic errors, my code worked and passed all checks. I currently run in 1.785s. |
