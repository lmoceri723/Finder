| 10/29 |  1:15-1:45pm  | I went to the board and started brainstorming a solution. I realized that the data needed to be hashed, and I initially settled on a BST to store the hashes. After talking with classmates, we realized a hashmap would be a better approach. We spent a lot of time ironing out the specific details around how we would implement our approach. |

Then, we did some math to find our ideal prime number for hashing and map size. It came out to 249998741. |
