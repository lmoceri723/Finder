| 10/29 |  1:15-1:45pm  | I went to the board and started brainstorming a solution. I realized that the data needed to be hashed, and I initially settled on a BST to store the hashes. After talking with classmates, we realized a hashmap would be a better approach. We spent a lot of time ironing out the specific details around how we would implement our approach. |
| 10/31 | 10:50-11:20am |                                                                                                                We spent a while as a class talking out how we wanted to approach this problem and generalized the concept of a hash map. Then, we did some math to find our ideal prime number for hashing and map size. It came out to 249998741. |
| 10/31 | 11:20-11:50am |                           I started writing code according to our plans from the beginning of class. I reached a bug where I had negative indices, so I added p to the hash and did another %p. I also realized I needed to store key value pairs in the map, so I added them. I pass all but one test case, and this last failure is due to time. |
